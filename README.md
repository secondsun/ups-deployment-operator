Unified Push Deployment Operator

# Getting started

You deploy the operator, create a UPS CR, watch it work

This tutorial has instructions I am using https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk

# Notes
UPS name is hardcoded
UPS Namesapce is the namespace the operator is running in and is global/managed in openshift
UPS Image and verison is hardcoded or in the cr?
